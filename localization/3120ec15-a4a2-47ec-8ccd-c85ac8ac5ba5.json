It may have been hand in hand with the rising economic growth. Everyone felt they had to stay busy and get as much done as possible in order to succeed at their lives. Making coffee was usually the matter of pressing a single button. Convenience brought us the likes of Tassimo, Nespresso and other many similar amenities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, though, everything seems to be slowing down. People take time. Or maybe, they just gave up and they don\u0027t bother being in a rush any more. This brought a renaissance of rediscovering the forgotten.

Looking at some of the more complicated brewers especially so. Take vacuum coffee makers, for example.

Not surprisingly, then, many of us give up and opt for the ‘convenient’ way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’ll go through some of the simple of these brewing methods.
